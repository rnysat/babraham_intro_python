Organism names 

â€¢ Write a script to correctly format organism scientific names (eg Homo sapiens). 

o It should interactively ask for the Genus (eg homo) and Species (eg sapiens) using input() statements 
o It should then print out the name with the Genus with an uppercase initial letter and the species all in lowercase. 
o Look at the capitalize and lower methods in the str class to do these transformations.
